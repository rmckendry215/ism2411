# Reflection Questions: Answer in 2-3 sentences each.

# In Exercise 3 you saw the difference between .get() and bracket notation. When in real work would you use each one, and what's your rule of thumb for choosing?
#

# Exercise 8 asked you to build a summary dictionary with a loop. What does this pattern remind you of from Excel, and why might the Python version be more useful for large datasets?
